# Autonomous guided vehicle simulation package
It is an prototype AGV simulation package which enables us to develop control software for the robot. It runs on Gazebo and works with ROS1. Both versions of ROS Melodic and Noetic are adaptable to work on. To download and use the package, enter the commands below in terminal:

cd ~/catkin_ws/src<br/>
git clone https://github.com/saricay/agv.git<br/>
cd ..<br/>
catkin_make<br/>
#or to compile the agv package only
cd ~/catkin_ws/srv/agv
source compile.sh
